PyANN
=====

An object oriented neural network.

###Methods of supervised learning:
*Backpropagation

###Goals:
- []Support for both feed-forward and recurrent networks
- []Browswer visualization of neural network in action

###Testing:
To simplify the use of test functions, use nosetests (downloaded with pip or
easy-install). Use the following line to run the backpropagation test
function:

'''nosetests --nocapture backPropagation.py'''
