PyANN
=====

A live vizualization of a generic artificial neural network written in Python2.7.
Visuals are done in Javascript and HTML5 canvas. The goal of the project is 
to help understand different kinds of learning and topological evolutionary 
algorithms for artificial neural networks.

###Methods of supervised learning:
*Backpropagation

###Goals:
-[ ]Support for both feed-forward and recurrent networks
-[ ]Browswer visualization of neural network in action
-[ ]Neuroevolution algorithm implementations

###Testing:
To simplify the use of test functions, use nosetests (downloaded with pip or
easy-install). Use the following line to run the backpropagation test
function:

```
pip install nosetests
nosetests --nocapture backPropagation.py
```
